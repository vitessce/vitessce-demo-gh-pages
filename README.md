## React app setup

This repo uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for a demo version of creating a basic [Vitessce] (https://vitessce.io/) App

It was created by using the following command 
```
npm create vite@latest vitessce-demo-gh-pages -- --template react
```

To start the app
```sh
cd vitessce-demo-gh-pages
npm install
npm install react@18.0.0 react-dom@18.0.0 
npm run dev
# Press Ctrl-C to stop the development server.
```
Notes: React version 18 is compatible with Vitessce. At the time of writing, the latest version of Vite is `6.3.5`.
